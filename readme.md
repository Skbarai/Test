## Some Helpful Concepts and commands

```bash
git status
```
very and handy yet very helpfull command you will use through your git & gihub journey. As the name suggests the command will  tell you the status (Untracked, staged and commited).  

Basically there are three working area in git:
- Untracked : once created file in the git repo(local or remote repo) will be untracked until it is added to stagging area.
- Staged  : Once you say the git to add it puts the copy of untracked to the stagging area.The staged area file will be the copy of untracked and any changes in the local file will not appear in the staged file until you again add.  
To add all the untracked files to staging area
```bash
git add .
```
- Commited : Once you have done all the work and added to the stagging area now you can  commit to tell that it is the final file.
To commit the changes
```bash
git commit -m "Some message"
```  
And now you can push the file to your github repository.

## Pushing to github
To push the file to your github repository

```git
git push -u origin main
```
Use git status in each steps for clear understanding.


## How to revert commit?
```git
git revert HEAD  
```
This 
changes the commit.  
Now push the file again after final commit.

## How to unpush the pushed repo?
```git
 git reset HEAD~1   
 git push -f origin main  
 ``` 
These two commands will unpush the pushed repo as they never been published on githubðŸ˜†.
